How to use? 

You can edit the dropdown list through data validation to edit the choices to what you are going to sell, and edit the pricing to match your needs. For example, for our booth, we sold some food and offered a nerf game (so, those are the choices in the dropdown menu). The cash in column will automatically calculate how much the cost (through  a formula multiplying the number of products with how much it costs). For a closer look of how this works, you can view the formula of the “cash in column”.
